Requirement Analysis in Software Development

 This Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements

What is Requirement Analysis?

  Requirement Analysis is the process of gathering, validating, and documenting what a software system must do and under what constraints it must work. It serves as the crucial bridge between stakeholders' requirements and the technical design and implementation phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). 

Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is crucisal in SDLC because it:
  a) Establishes a Solid Foundation - ensuring that each step (design, coding) is all in line with the user needs and stakeholder needs
  b) Mitigates Risk Early - we are able to identify costly, unfeasable requirements early before development starts
  c) Improves Quality and User Satisfaction - Aligns deliverables with stakeholder expectations, leading to higher acceptance rates at each review and in final release.
  d)
